# NOTES

The code under this directory is based on the SCI library of Microsoft's [EzPC](https://github.com/mpc-msri/EzPC) project and Alibaba Gemini Lab's [OpenCheetah](https://github.com/Alibaba-Gemini-Lab/OpenCheetah/tree/main/SCI) project.

The Silent-OT primitives are based on the [Ferret](https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-ot/tree/master/emp-ot/ferret) library and the [libOTe](https://github.com/osu-crypto/libOTe.git) library.

We fulfill this repository as a standlone MPC backend supporting the 2PC computations involved in FedGraph.
